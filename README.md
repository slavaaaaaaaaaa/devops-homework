# DevOps Homework

This is a set of assignments for gauging learning and operational skills of a potential Jr. Site Reliability Engineer or DevOps candidate. Questions are expected to be asked, no resource is off-limits - except, naturally, other folks. Please put in your best effort to do the work yourself.

## Purpose

The outcome of this is for both the potential applicant and the potential hirer to gauge how much of a fit one would be for the industry. Here are the values we seek:

- quick adaptation to environments, new tooling, new technologies
- ability to clearly analyze things when something went wrong: post-mortem
- ability to [write excellent code](https://slava.lol/posts/excellent-code/)
- ability to ask questions when needed, and in time (before too much time has passed trying to figure something out)

## Assignments

1. [Google Kubernetes Engine](gke.md)
1. [Continuous Integration, Continous Delivery](ci.md)
1. [Configuration Management](cm.md)
1. [Infrastructure as Code](iac.md)
1. [Cloud](cloud.md)

## Notes

No resource is off-limits, that includes the potential hirer who sent you this. Asking questions is a _must_, some even set a timer for figuring something out: usually, thirty minutes. The only limitation we ask for is to avoid asking others to do the work for you.

A strategy everyone is fond of is talking an object through your problem (this has classically been a poor rubber duck). Walk it through the entire problem, beginning to end: usually, one stumbles into whatever they've missed. My personal strategy has been to imagine how I will explain the problem when it comes time to ask questions to my coworkers. This is a combination of both of the above.

Finally, it's worth noting that these **won't be helpful to everyone**. Specifically, I and many extremely effective engineers I've worked with *learn by doing* - these kinds of assignments are real cases of work I've been thrown at to figure out on the spot. Not everyone learns this way: many other effective engineers I've worked with learn by reading books and preparing for a specific subject by generating deep knowledge, not trying things out. It's okay to be on either side of the equation as long as you know your limitations and are a useful part of the team!

## Expectations

The assignment lengths and depths are planned to take two to three days of research and work, but something that would take minutes to put together in a work environment.

## Communication

It would be preferred to communicate over something other than SMS or email: use a simple chat medium to communicate such as IRC, Slack, Discord. The simple requirements for a friendly platform are ability to:

- perform code formatting and
- run on a computer
